# Zero-DCE: Low-Light Image Enhancement

## Introduction

### Architecture Used
In this project, we implemented the Zero-DCE (Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation) model to enhance low-light images. Zero-DCE is a deep learning model designed to enhance low-light images by estimating pixel-wise light enhancement curves. The model operates without the need for paired low/normal light images during training, making it a highly efficient and versatile solution for low-light image enhancement.

- **Image Size:** 256 x 256
- **Batch Size:** 16
- **Max Training Images:** 400
- **Learning Rate:** 1e-4
- **Epochs:** 100

### Performance Metrics for Traning data

#### Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR)
The term Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is an expression for the ratio between the maximum possible value (power) of a signal and the power of distorting noise that affects the quality of its representation. Because many signals have a very wide dynamic range (ratio between the largest and smallest possible values of a changeable quantity), the PSNR is usually expressed in terms of the logarithmic decibel scale. The higher the PSNR, the better the quality of the compressed image.

### PSNR Value Achieved
The Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) value achieved on the training dataset is computed during evaluation and reported below.

#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a measure of the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. It provides an idea of how well the model is performing by penalizing larger errors more than smaller ones. Lower values of MSE indicate better performance.

The formula for MSE is:
\[ \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \]

#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. Itâ€™s the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all individual differences have equal weight.

The formula for MAE is:
\[ \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i| \]

## Project Details

### Training Code
The training code for the Zero-DCE model is executed with the specified hyperparameters and data preprocessing steps.

### Evaluation Metrics
Upon training completion, the model is evaluated on the training dataset using the following metrics:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Summary and Future Improvements

### Findings
The Zero-DCE model effectively enhances low-light images by estimating pixel-wise light enhancement curves. The model achieves competitive PSNR values, indicating a significant improvement in image quality. The visual results also demonstrate the model's capability to enhance image details and overall brightness without introducing significant artifacts.

### Future Improvements
To further enhance the model, the following approaches can be considered:
- Data Augmentation: Augmenting the training dataset with more diverse low-light images can improve the model's robustness and generalization.
- Advanced Loss Functions: Incorporating additional loss functions such as perceptual loss can improve the visual quality of the enhanced images.
- Model Architecture: Experimenting with more advanced neural network architectures, such as attention mechanisms, can further enhance the model's performance.

By implementing these improvements, we can continue to push the boundaries of low-light image enhancement and achieve even better results in future iterations of this project.
